# KNN-Classification-Project
This code implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify a dataset with preprocessing steps, including feature normalization.
 The code includes:

Data Preprocessing: Features are normalized to prepare the dataset for the KNN classification algorithm.

KNN Algorithm: Implements the KNN classifier using scikit-learn to predict class labels for the given dataset.

Visualization: Compares the feature distributions before and after normalization using bar plots, helping to illustrate the impact of preprocessing on the data.
